# Contactbook

Small project I did to learn **Angular** during my training with the training organisation *Simplon*. This is a small app to save contacts (persons or societies) from a form and vizualize them as a "cards" list.

The app is unfinished and will stay so, but it contains explanatory notes (in French) that could be useful to re-do the same features or learn Angular, so I'll leave it here.

Feel free to use.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
